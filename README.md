# Text-Analyzer
A command line program that analyzes words in huge texts, displaying frequency of any word the user wants, top 5 most used words, least 5 used words etc.

Since the language of choice is C++, the program is blazingly fast even for large texts like War and Peace. Furthermore, a binary search tree was implemented allowing for much faster execution.
